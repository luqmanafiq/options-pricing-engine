# options-pricing-engine
I built a comprehensive options pricing system using the Black-Scholes model. It has three main components: an analytical pricing engine using closed-form solutions, a Monte Carlo simulator for exotic options, and an implied volatility solver using Newton-Raphson. The UI lets you see how Greeks change in real-time with interactive 3D visualizations
